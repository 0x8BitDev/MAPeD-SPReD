The 'Exported Data Viewer' was created for testing of exported data and debugging of the SGDK exporter.

It displays the SGDK data export options, main exported data depending on the data mode (multidirectional
scrolling, bidirectional scrolling, static screens switching) and also you can navigate through screens
data to adjacent screens when the 'bidirectional scrolling' or 'static screens' modes are active.

The steps to use:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Export your project here with a 'tilemap' name and run the 'compile_SGDK.bat'
2. In the './out' directory you'll find the compiled SMD image - 'rom.bin'
